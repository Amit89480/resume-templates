Companies get tax benefits if they hire freshers and train them for 1 year. So, companies visit engineering colleges and recruit freshers even though they have required number of engineers with them.

There are many ways to get placed:

1. Construction companies go to some reputed colleges to offer placement.

Depending on the market scenario, companies prepare their requirement and go to the colleges for placement. So, it is difficult to say which companies go for placements.

2. You need to have some contacts with some company or you can approach them directly.

3. You can go for Off Campus placements.

If you wish to get placed in big construction firms like L&T, Tata Projects, HCC etc, go to their respective websites, find CAREERS option and search for vacancies.

If you visit their website, you will at least end up finding some email id or a contact number of the HR person.

Mail them your resume or speak to the HR person and enquire them for placements.
