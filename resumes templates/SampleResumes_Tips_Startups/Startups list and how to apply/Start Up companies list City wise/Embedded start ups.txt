As per as my concern if you want to work in Embedded domain, you have to grow your knowledge in core electronics domain , Now lets talk about to Embedded Systems. For Knowing how An Embedded System works you have to know certain things and go step by step.

1). Learn C programming thoroughly(Bit-wise Operator/Call by value/Call by reference/Pointer/Array/Function/Structure/Dynamic Memory Allocation).

2). Learn Electronics (Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory) (PDF you can find in web) and Digital Electronics.

3). Learn Micro-controller from basic to higher version (AT89c51/Arduino/ARM/STM32F427).

4). Learn Communication Protocol(I2C/SPI/UART/CAN).

5). Get practical hands on experience in tools(KEIL uVision, AVR Studio, Arduino,STm32 Cube, Proteus) , where you will know how to write, debug and dumped a code in micro-controller.

6). Build some DIY kits(Sensor Shield/GSM shield/Ultrasonic Sensor).

Now Lets come to the Linux part. Different websites are there for learning. But its upto u how you are grabbing.

Steps to be followed:

Learn basic Linux command(pwd/ls/mkdir/fprintf/fscanf/fopen/fclose)
Learn Signal/Alarm/wait/sleep cooammand
Learn IPC deeply(Pipe/Named Pipe/Shared Memory/Message Queue)
Learn Thread and process (how to create thread, process and communication beetween them ).
Semaphore and mutex.
Socket Programming(create/bind/accept/listen/read/write/close)
After completion of this , then go to driver part.

Less theory and do coding.

I hope Definitely it will help.
