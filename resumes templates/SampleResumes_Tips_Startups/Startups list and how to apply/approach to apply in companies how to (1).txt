2) Before commenting anything/ Or Doing any kind of R&D on this Post make sure is this really right or not?
3) Keep Calm..!! And just follow whatever I am going to write here… and you must have to implement all procedure OR To do all things and without doing these you can’t expect any interview call.
4) Don’t think that you have already done these things and didn’t get anything which I am going to write here because there is huge different between you and any other Individual that how and what approach he/she using while applying OR It depends / vary person to person that how effectively you are applying..!!!
