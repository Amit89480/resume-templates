3. Only technical skills not required to get job. You have to work on all areas.

So start your preparation in a well planned manner Like -

1) Aptitude & Reasoning - If you are technically very good but you don't have good apti and reasoning knowledge than no use of your skills as this is the elimination round in all the companies. 
So give more time to aptitude and reasoning.

Prepare common topics which usually asked in all companies :

-> Speed Time and Distance.
-> Profit loss
-> %
-> AP GP
-> Blood relation
-> Number system 
-> Syllogism 
-> Mixtures 
-> Series

These are few common topics which you should prepare first.

2) GD or JAM -
This round is also an elimination round. So try to work on it more and everyday give 1 hour for communication skills.

If your communication is not good start working.

-> Watch cartoon in English.
-> Communicate with your friends in english.
-> Read newspaper, learn 5 new words from dictionary and try to make sentence.
-> Try to solve people queries in english stop talking in regional language.
-> Best way is make a friend who don't know hindi or regional langauge so forcefully you have to talk in english with him/her.

3) Technical Round -

If you are a fresher nobody expect you to be a pro what they check is how confident you are.

So learn any coding language and learn one platform(OS)linux or unix.

And those who are new before attending any drive atleast prepare these common programs.

-> String reverse
-> Odd even
-> Addidation , substraction , Muliplication.
-> Array
-> Fibonacci series
-> Palindrome series
-> Pattern programs 
-> Basic looping programs

4) HR round / Manager Round -

Communication is the key to crack this round just work on communication skills.
