Format of a resume.

All of the big companies, brands, and good start-ups use the Application tracking system or ATS. If you are submitting a resume online it will most likely go into the ATS and an ATS works best with a standard format and design.

The ATS looks for Keywords and it doesn’t work well with shaded areas, colors, odd-shaped bullet points, columns, and strange fonts.

Be it a recruiter, hiring manager, or ATS, everyone expects to see the Information in a format.

Now, this is a very basic format.

Basic Details – Name, number, Address (Name of city and state), URL for LinkedIn or website.
Objective – Optional (Necessary if you are a fresher or Changing your career)
Summary – Optional (Necessary for experienced professional)
Education or Experience – Based on how much experience you have
On Experience – Date of employment should be on the right side of the page (Month and Year), Most recent experience should be on the top and then follow the chronology.
In the end or on the side (a different section) you should Include the Skill, Certificate, Achievements or any other information related to your field.

Make it easy to read but not boring.
