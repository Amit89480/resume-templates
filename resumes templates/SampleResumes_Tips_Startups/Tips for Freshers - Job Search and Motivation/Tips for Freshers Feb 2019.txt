I have seen many Freshers asking questions about job offers being fake or original.Check the following to assess :
1: Email Address of the sender-- It will be directly from the company with the company domain name : example - kriti.surva@infosys.com etc
2: They will provide you with details of the offer and the JD.
3: If it comes from consultancy never ever pay anything to these consultancies. Remember this- the consultancies get paid from these Companies like HP/Infosys/ Wipro etc
4: In case you gave the interview, and they are not replying back, wait as the process takes a long time.
5: Incase you have a job offer and yet to join keep on searching and don't just waste the time. As sometimes offers may be cancelled or delayed due to innumerable technical reasons.

At the end of it all post here to get an experienced view from the members of this group.

P.S. Request everybody to add in if there is any thing that I missed.
