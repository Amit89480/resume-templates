#Pay_attention_to_your 55%

Suppose that you are appearing for an interview. This is a dream job that you always wanted. You have done all your preparation. You know all the answers and you know about all the technicalities of your field.

But, do you know that all your technical (your field related) preparation contributes only 7% to your chances of getting your dream job?

In 1970, UCLA psychology Professor Albert Mehrabian suggested that words hardly matter in making up our feelings and beliefs about others. According to his studies, what matters the most is the other person's body language. To quantify his conclusions, he created 7-38-55 rule.

According to this rule, only 7% of a communication is based on the words, 38% comes from the tone of voice and 55% from the speaker’s body language and face.
So, what you speak (your answers) contributes only 7% to your chances of getting your dream job. This is exactly why you need to start paying attention to your body language in interviews.

Of course, you need to give satisfactory answers as well. Correct answers (7%) are crucial in clearing an interview, but having correct body language (55%) along with correct answers can increase your chances of getting your dream job with better pay.
