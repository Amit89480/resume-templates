1. Do not use the same resume for every job and position. Read the duties and responsibilities carefully and make necessary changes to your resume accordingly. Even though a person with experience in the manager will apply for an entry level position, but if his experience and skill matching with the position. No one will hire him.  

2. Always add a cover letter with resumes and explain that you can give to the company on your behalf.  

3. Do not leave the company in a short time. At least complete 1 year or first promotion or first increment. If you are leaving the company and looking for another job, it is difficult to negotiate the package with HR and chances of interview calls are less because HR feels that if you get a good option then you will leave this company too. But if you have a good option when you are working in your current company then better to go. 

4. Do not depend on job portals only. Try to call the companies directly and ask them if there are jobs available matching your skills. Email your resume to the company, ask your friends for a reference or if they can drop the hard-copy of the resume to work place.  
5.Make a list of all companies in your cities and start calling, emailing, or go to the company directly if possible to drop your resume. 

6. If you are going for an interview then do research about the company such as history, technology etc. Show your interest to join the company during the interview. After the interview send a thank you email and if you are not selected, ask for feedback.
