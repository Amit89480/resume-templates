1.Guys go outside and explore. I know weather is not so cool but the biggest problem is not going and attend walkins unless and until you get call. Wat is wrong in trying if companies are not allowing, at least try no one know whn your luck hits and you come home as a happiest person.

2.Study hard. If you have big dreams then you need to put in extra ordinary efforts to accomplish them. I have seen people don't work on their skills they just wait for opportunity. Don't believe on luck, there are only 5 people in 100 who are lucky but another 95 are hard working. You should have as much knowledge that even if 1000 people are being interviewed, you should be the one to be selected.

3. In these days if you will be free for somtime but don't get frustrated and it happens when you missed an oppertunity so don't regret for that instead keep yourself busy and motivated. You can read novels, prepare for aptitude test and so many things. You should be very good in aptitutse as the 1st round of all companies contains written and that is the door of success if you cleared written round.
#StayMotivated

4.Stay positive and motivated. How many of you observe and make list of the question asked in the interivew, I know very few of them so from next time nake a list of the question and prepare thm well before attending next interview as most of the companies don't ask rocket science from fresher and question are very similar.

5. Last but most important, Only a job seeker can feel that, Sometime we say, wish I would be in place of this and that guy, I know the frustration and dream and the guy to whome you are comparing is also reached that place by hard work so but don't lose yourself and don't let negative thoughts to squander in your mind.
