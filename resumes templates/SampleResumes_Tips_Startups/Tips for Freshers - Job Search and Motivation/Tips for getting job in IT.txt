============= Being as Experience :- ==========

Resume name should be :- YourName_Your_profile_YearOF_experience

Email subject Line :- Please keep in mind this

1. IF you already got a mail from HR person then Just click on Reply all and don't change the Subject Line.

2. IF you are applying with Fresh e-mail then Mention subject line as : Applying for XYZ Profile ( Ex: APplying for Testing profile )

Email body or say Cover letter :-

Being as Experience you don't need to descibe about yourself in mail body.. You can just mention recruiter name with Saying Hi and then mention short intro about your profile and company name .......

THEN Also mention your Current CTS , Expected CTC and Notice period .!!

ALso Make sure.....if you are Immediate JoINer then Please highlight this in SUBJECT LINE....so Recruiter will show more interest on your PROFILE.!

#Step 3 :- IF you are going to attend any interview then please try to prepare as much as you can for all rounds of interview, As i can see most of people simply writing written test and thinking ' God will help me to clear this round' then i can perform well in technical n all .....

#Friend As always saying each and every rounds are important for getting a job, meanwhile with your lack of preparation you just wasting your opportunity .....

SO please focus on all area's

#Step 4 :- Communication Skills : Some people saying i don't have good communication and all, but as per me main problem is you don't have proper knowledge on your subject ......

Just for example : Everyone using whatsapp / facebook, if someone ask you to speak for 10 min on same then you can talk for more than 30 minute too because you know about facebook/ whatsapp feature and all ...

So same thing apply for our skills, IF you are having good skills, if you really prepared then i am hopping you can answer all questions fluently ......

Also communication issue come because of lack of confidence .....So please be confident, don't feel nervous on any interview . .
