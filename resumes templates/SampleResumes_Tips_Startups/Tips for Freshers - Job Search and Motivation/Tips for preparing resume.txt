1. Spend atleast 2-3 hours once in your life to work on your resumes. ITS IS REALLY IMPORTANT HOW YOUR RESUME IS FORMATTED IN A CORRECT MANNER AND HOW IT LOOKS. Your resumes are how you advertise yourself. If you do it bad, no one would care.
2. FRESHERS: DO NOT KEEP YOUR RESUME MORE THAN 2 PAGES. Actually it has to be of only one page. Still 2 pages is acceptable. I got resumes which had 5-6 pages and it was really sad to see.
3. GO ONLINE TO SEARCH FOR SOME GOOD RESUME FORMATS. Dont just type anything you want in any font and send. It really looks bad and creates a bad impression. The recruiters will throw away your resume in one second after looking at how it looks.
4. DO NOT include unnecessary things in your resume. Just include the things which matter the MOST. Adding your photo IS NOT NECESSARY.
5. Use Calibri or Arial font. Keep font size 12-16 for headings and 10-12 for content. Dont use funky fonts or headings, keep it simple and neat looking. Use bullet points wherever necessary while writing multiple things in points.
