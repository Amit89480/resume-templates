#Tips_For_Jobseeker

Be vulnerable
It’s okay to ask people for advice! “Too often we think we have to sell ourselves as this know-it-all hot-shot to get a job, but I have found the best way to build relationships with people whom you'd like to work with (or for) is to start by being vulnerable, sharing your admiration for their work, and asking for advice.

Don't always follow your passion
"Follow your passion" is one of the most common pieces of career wisdom.If you study people who end up loving their work, most of them did not follow a pre-existing passion, he says. “Instead, their passion for the work developed over time as they got better at what they did and took more control over their career.”

Create your position
Don’t just sit around waiting for your “dream job” to open. Study the industry or field that you’re looking to move into, and determine a company or two that you’d like to work for.Then figure out their challenges through relationships or public information. With this, you can craft a solution for them that you can share directly or publically through a blog, for instance.

Learn how to listen
Job seekers are so caught up in conveying a certain message and image to the employer that they often fail to listen.
Know when to talk, when to stop talking, and when to ask questions.

Start at the top and move down.

Focus on body language
Body language is incredibly important in job interviews.Watching yours (posture, your hands, whether or not you're relaxed, confidence) will help you exude confidence.
