No doubt every day you people getting some opportunities, no matter whether its a Direct Walkin or through Referral n all right ?

So Following to this wonderful quote just want to add few more :-

1. IF you really Feel you are getting job opportunities OR if you feel you will get opportunities based on your good skill, your good % THEN why you can't concentrate for your preparation first ?

Not saying don't attend interview for month or year ....but at-least First prepare well THEN Attend interviews !

YOU All know One Perfect Opportunity can change your LIFE but making some opportunities as perfect first you should concentrate for making yourself perfect .......

#Cool you can attend everyday opportunities for your interview experience..!!

#In General i can say Most companies asking quantitative Aptitude questions, verbal ability, Some companies conducting Group discussion for checking communication, Some companies checking good technical skill with good communication and THEN END how HR people checking good communication from each freshers with certain tech skill !

----------------------------------

GUYS ...........here you can catch Nine rabbits ( interview) Every day ...OR say in a week but If you really want to grab opportunities then concentrate on some opportunities, Not saying don't attend everyday walkin but at-least you can Improve your poor area's first then try to concentrate on catch on ONE rabbit ( interview ) !

------------------------------------------------

As Always saying here and again saying : Till not getting job you people will get job opportunities in N number of Ways but before that Just check are you guys really prepared or NOT? Having sufficient skill or not and all ............

#COOL....

#Conclusion :- Be a perfect job seekers for all aspects because well skilled, well deserved candidates are always demanded and always create n number of opportunities and can crack it by own personal perfect skill !
