Worrying ??? .........

#Please As of now Don't worry about your Less % , Concentrate on your preparation.........#IF you want to attend any kind of Interviews then just make it 60% in RESUME and try to clear Interviews !

If u r not having 60% then try to find those all companies wherever % not matter and accepting below 60% , like some company Syntel want 55% only , Accenture want 60% in BTECH only n few mores.......so find it and apply according.!!

======================
Hey all, hope you are doing great. If not then you should be.
This post is solely dedicated to 2018 btach people, cause I believe that most of you must be thinking that you have loads of time to find your desired job! lol
If you belong to the same league than you are in danger.
Let me justify it, you must be visiting portals like eLitmus, Amcat etc and there you must have seen that there are lots of companies which are hiring(now) so you have lot of opportunities. Wait! stop there, Yes you have lot of opportunities but THEY ARE NOT THERE FOREVER.
You have to act now!!
Many of you might not have took those exams yet. Why? beacuse you are not prepared. Okay! take 2 weeks leave everything and prepare yourselves. If you start today and are lucky enough two have your exam approximately after two weeks then you will get your scores and eligibility to apply for those companies after 1 month from now. By then many of the companies will be gone, but no worry there will surely be more.

Those who are prepared enough and gonna take their eLitmus soon let me contribute something for you.

I took elitmus 6 months ago after preparing for just 2-3 weeks (though I knew some concepts of quant and was an avid reader already)
I scored 75+ in VA, 97+ in PS, 98+ in QA.

Though I don't think it's the best score but it fetched me some good calls. (Except the core IT companies as I belong to non-IT Branch)

So how come I got the above score?

Just by preparing?

No.

I planned my test.

eLitmus is of 2 hours, well I didn't think of the 2 hours. I thought about only 120 minutes and split those 120 minutes in 3 parts i.e. 40 minutes for each section.

For VA,
I started with RCs followed by grammer which is a bit easier.
Make sure you get atleast 8-10 questions correct.

For PS,
don't get stuck with crypt arithmetic, It consumes lot of time and its not necessary that you will get it correct. There are 4 more sets , which are really do-able, you just need to get only 1 and half set correct and this will fetch u really good percentile.

For QA,

There are few questions which can be solved in 1 or 2 minutes, You just need to indentify them. Just start reading from 1st question If you know how to do it, you do it. You don't know how to do it you CAN NOT do it and MOVE to the next question. There are 5-6 easily solvable questions, Which can fetch more than 90 percentile. And then there are long but solvable questions which take 4-5 minutes, you can solve them too if you are left with time. Make sure to attempt atleast 8-10 questions.

There won't be any negative marking for first 25% of attempted questions, So you also have the liberty of 
few approximations and JAI MATA DI
