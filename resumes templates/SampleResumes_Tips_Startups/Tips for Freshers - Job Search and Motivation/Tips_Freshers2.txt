Guys don't look for a job in any specific domain. Be flexible and be open to all opportunities. Bcz as a fresher if you will look for a job in any particular domain you will miss other opportunities.

Nobody expects you to be a 360 degree all rounder. Just work on your communication skills.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who are 2015 passout don't wait now better try to search job as 1 yr exp person or as 2016 fresher and in HR round if you reach tell the truth and try to convince them.

And one more thing you guys do create 2 profiles in naukri.com one as a fresher and other as a exp folks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Those who are 2016 passout only one suggestion don't follow blindly or don't do hard work blindly. First figure out what problems you are facing and why you are getting rejected. write and discuss with your friend how you can improve this.

second thing try to get job first don't stick to one domain. Attend all the walkin and just wait for an opportunity you don't need 100 to get job,one is enough.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2017 passout instead of joijning institutes focus on your skillset. Bcz if you will join any institute first thing you will waste your moiney. Second thing you can't attend walkins and you will miss many opportunities which are coming to you during your training time.

So attend 2 to 3 walkins note down your mistakes and start working on them.

Create your profile in angle list, naukri and internshala.

That's more than enough.
