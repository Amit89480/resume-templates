Objective In the resume.

You may hear that no one reads an objective but if you are writing an objective expect that people will read it.
If you can write a good objective then it can produce real value.

What’s the traditional understanding of the Objective – Define the role you want to apply and add your skills.

Also’ If you are changing your Career or have less/no experience then an objective can help a recruiter understand why you applied for a particular job.

If you have many years of experience, then a summary of experience & qualification will work best for you.
