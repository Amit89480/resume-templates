Introduce yourself this is very important how you present yourself in front of recruiter. We take this part very lightly but most of us are not able to tell about ourself more than 30 sec or while giving Intro many presents irrelevant info.
Follow these things......
First tell your name ,college name , branch and aggregate.
Than tell your career objective which should be related to company growth and your growth as well.
Than tell your technical skills what you know what you don't know. Your primary skills and secondary skills and if you are very good at any particular area or topics you can tell that.
