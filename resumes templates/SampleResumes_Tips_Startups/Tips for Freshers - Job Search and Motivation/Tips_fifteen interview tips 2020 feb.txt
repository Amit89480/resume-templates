Fifteen interview tips...

Research about the company/ client before you show-up for the interview

Find out about the hiring process in detail

Always carry a hard-copy of your Resume

Appear confident and portray a positive body language

Know  your Resume/ CV in and out. Do not write anything which you are not  confident of (Sounds strange but people do write stuff which they don't  know)

Answer to "Tell me something about yourself" has to be short and sweet

Be  a good listener. Let the interviewer complete the question before you  

start giving the answer. Don't assume the answer by listening only to a  portion of the question

While solving written assignments: Be organized, don't be messy

If you don't know the answer - Just say 'I don't know' and move on to the next question

Be prepared to quote some real life examples from your previous job experience

Answer to the point. Don't beat around the bush

Ask questions to the interviewer about the company/ job/ role being offered

If English is the business language - Speak in English, don't switch to regional/ local language

Practice 'Mock Interviews' with friends/ relatives

Attend  telephonic interviews from a place where there is no disturbance,  

always have a copy of CV in front of you when you speak on phone
