1. Cold calling
According to me cold calling is the fast way to apply for a job. Make a #list of companies (prefer start up) and start calling them. Ask if there any job that good for you. They will tell you if you can come for Interview or they will guide you how to apply for those position.

Always start a conversation with your #introduction (don't forget to ask how you are?) And ask if you can talk to someone in the HR / Recruitment department.

If they transfer you to the right department. Start the conversation with the introduction again, and explain to them that you are interested in this company and your skills / experience.


2. Email
Sometimes we have low grades in 10/ + 2/ degree , so whenever we try to apply a job in some companies, it does not allow to process our application to next step because of not have cut off, or even if we have applied then company will filter the application and prefer those who have cut off.
Email is a good option to apply. Make the #list of companies (prefer start up) and email them. Always use a PDF file for your resume with a perfect file name (name_B.tech_CSE_Java skill). Write a perfect cover letter and explain to the company what you can offer them on your behalf. Write a subject line according to the position and location of the job.

3.Fax
Yes, you can apply for the job through fax also. If you want to drop/ send resume to a company in your city and the company is #far away from your location. Do not waste your time in travel. Fax your resume with a cover letter.

4. Company career portal
Most MNC prefer to post their jobs on their company's portal so that they can easily #filter applications. When you are applying for a job at the company's carrier port, check if there is an option for #additional_files. Upload your #certification there.

5.Job portals
The most common ways to apply for a job. My suggestion applies daily 30-40 jobs (#should_be_related_to_your_education_interest_and_experience). You will get a lot of interview calls. Make sure not to use the same resume for all jobs. Read duties and responsibilities and make necessary changes

6. Walk In Jobs
Before you are going to participate in any Walk In Jobs in a company,

1. Check jobs and responsibilities
2. Is that job fit for you
3. Collect information about companies (#history, #awards, technology, #head_person etc.)
4. Check the interview round details.
5. Check company reviews.
Prepare well for the interview. If you are going there to attend the interview without preparation, then you are just wasting your money and time.

7.Resume drop
If you have free time, try to visit the company with your #updated_resume and be prepared if they are ready for an on-the-spot interview.
Note: Not all companies will allow you to enter their building.

8.Friend reference
Stay in touch with your school / college / institute friend. If a position is available in their company, ask them to refer you.
Again, if someone refers you to this company it does not mean that the company will hire you. Refer means that someone suggested / informed you about the company and the job. The company will hire you only when you are fit for the company and how you will represent yourself in interviews and tests.
NOTE: - Company #does_not care what skills you have. They care about what skills #they_need.

9.Job fair
Keep #checking online for job fair in your city

10. After every 2-3 days, keep #updating your profile on the job portal. The company always prefer to call updated profiles.
