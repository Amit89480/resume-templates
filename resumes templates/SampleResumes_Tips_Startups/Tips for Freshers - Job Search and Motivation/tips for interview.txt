1) Don't depend on any one while searching for job.
2) Firstly figure out what you want to choose for your career.
3) Have patience and try to cope with critics.
4) Make a routine and plan and stick to it, because if you desire is strong enough, you will achieve it for sure.
5) Don't give money to anyone for job. And make sure you call the company and ask for interview details and their registration process. Because most of the time you will encounter that the company is asking for money for registration. So avoid such things and focus on preparation.
6) Doing just training will not give job. Give yourself some time of at least 6 to 12 months if you are starting your job search now. Please practice coding on your own, if you want to be a programmer.
7) And before joining any training institution, please do get reviews from those who have already trained and who are honest in giving you the right information.
8) There is no such thing called 100% placement, it depends these factors:
* choice of the course
* choice of the institution
* your grasping power
* the amount of productive work you do in your domain
* and if you are passed out in before or in 2014, you need to have the patience and ability to cope with critics.
